## **_Description_**

### This application connects community theater-goers to the cast and crew of the current production. The theater creates information for each show (Title, production dates, length, and a cast/crew list) and a profile for each member of the show (volunteer photo, name, role, previous roles, and a short blurb from the volunteer).

### The home page will have a list of this seson's shows. The name and role of each volunteer will be displayed on the show's page. When a user clicks on the name, it will open up to a page that displays the rest of the profile information.

### The two Mongoose components: Shows & Volunteers

## **Future Development Opportunity (Post MVP)**

### Under the display of each volunteer's profile, there will be a compiled biography of every role they have had in any show for the theater using the app. Under that will be a field where users can enter their name and a short message to the volunteer. When they submit it, the message will be displayed on their profile.

### The post, update, and delete page for shows and volunteers will be hidden behind an authentication wall, so that the general public cannot alter the data bases.

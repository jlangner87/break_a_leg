### **Future Development Opportunity (Post MVP)**

#### Each show will compile a list of volunteers associated with that show. The list will be a clickable link that routes the user to the volunteer's profile

#### Under the display of each volunteer's profile, there will be a compiled biography of every role they have had in any show for the theater using the app. Under that will be a field where users can enter their name and a short message to the volunteer. When they submit it, the message will be displayed on their profile.

#### Shows will be categorized by a "season" key value in the object. The "Shows" page will then be a list of seasons that users can navigate to.

#### The post, update, and delete page for shows and volunteers will be hidden behind an authentication wall, so that the general public cannot alter the data bases.

### **Known Bugs**

#### Put request inserts an empty object with a new object ID.

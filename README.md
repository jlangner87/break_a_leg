### **_Description_**

#### This application connects community theater-goers to the cast and crew of the current production. The theater creates information for each show (Title, production dates, length, and a cast/crew list) and a profile for each member of the show (volunteer photo, name, role, previous roles, and a short blurb from the volunteer).

#### The home page will have a list of this seson's shows. The name and role will be displayed on the show page. When a user clicks on the name, it will open up to a page that displays the rest of the profile information. Under the display, there will be a field where users can enter their name and a short message to the volunteer. When they submit it, the message will be displayed on their profile.

#### The two components: Shows & Volunteer
